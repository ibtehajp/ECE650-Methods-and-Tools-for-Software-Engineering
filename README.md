## Assignment 1
This takes street coordinates as input and generates a graph. 

## Assignment 2
This program generates a shortest path between two points in a graph.

## Assignment 3
This program generates random street specifications and generates a graph using the program from Assignment 1. Then the shortest path is found by using the program from Assignment 2. All of the communication among the 3 programs is done using IPC.

## Assignment 4
This program finds the smallest vertex cover using the Mini-SAT alogrithm. All of the communication among the programs us done using IPC.

## Project
This program adds two more algorithms for finding the minimum vertex cover of a graph in addition to the Mini-SAT algorithm. The vertex cover and the time taken to generate the vertex cover is analysed.
